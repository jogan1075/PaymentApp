# Project characteristics ðŸš€

This project brings to the table set of best practices, tools, and solutions:

* 100% [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* Modern architecture (Clean Architecture, Multi-Module setup, Model-View-ViewModel)
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* Single-activity architecture
* Dependency Injection ([Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/))
* Material Design

# Built With ðŸ› 

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - Kotlin's way of way of writing asynchronous, non-blocking code
  - [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow#stateflow) - notify views when the underlying data changes
  - [SharedFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow#sharedflow) - notify multiple subscribers that data changes 

- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps
  - [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
  - [Saved State](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel-savedstate) - Prevent data lost from system-initiated process death

- [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) - static code analysis tool for the Kotlin programming language
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Dependency Injection Framework
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android
